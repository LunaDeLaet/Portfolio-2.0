# Portfolio-2.0

I created this portfolio project to showcase where I stand within my trajectory towards becoming a web developer, for others but also for myself. 

The skills I used in this project, I learned through free online courses, such as FreeCodeCamp, Mimo App, and SoloLearn. 
I focused on mobile-first responsive design through Sass.

I really like making projects, and I am very motivated to make more and learn more about web development.
